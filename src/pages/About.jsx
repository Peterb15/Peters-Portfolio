        I'm Peter Burke — a designer, storyteller, and creative technologist. I thrive at the intersection of narrative and innovation, blending physical computing, fabrication, and media production to bring ideas to life. With a background in Creative Technology & Design and English (Creative Writing), I explore new ways of communicating ideas across platforms, mediums, and disciplines. Whether it’s a TTRPG series, an interactive installation, or a digital product, I aim to tell meaningful stories that connect people.
